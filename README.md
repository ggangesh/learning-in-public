## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**My Rules:**
1. **Learn by building** - No tutorial hell
2. **Explain simply** - If I can't explain it, I don't understand it
3. **Document gaps** - What tutorials don't tell you
4. **Share everything** - Someone else needs this
5. **Focus deeply** - One topic at a time

**My Process:**
```
Monday-Friday: Learn + Build (commit daily)
Saturday: Document (write + diagram)
Sunday: Share + Plan next week
```
